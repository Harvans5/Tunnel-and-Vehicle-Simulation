# Tunnel-and-Vehicle-Simulation
This project simulates various types of vehicles, using an abstract class for vehicle with sleds, cars and ambulances extending this class, traveling through multiple different tunnels with restrictions on amount, type and direction. This project utilizes various data structures and operating system techniques, using locks, threads, and priority queues for vehicles waiting to enter an open and suitable tunnel, with ambulances having highest prioirty, and also using hashmaps and linkedlists for storage and reference to the relations of tunnels to vehicles. Once a vehicle enters a tunnel it will stay in the tunnel for a certain amount of time before it exits at which point if the prioirty queue isn't empty a new suitable vehicle will enter.
