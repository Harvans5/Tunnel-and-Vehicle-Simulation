# Tunnel-and-Vehicle-Simulation
This project simulates various types of vehicles, using an abstract class for vehicle with sleds, cars and ambulances extending this class and representing threads, traveling through multiple different tunnels with restrictions on amount, type and direction. This project utilizes various data structures and operating system techniques, using locks and conditions to prevent the threads from busy-waiting and priority queues for vehicles waiting to enter an open and suitable tunnel. Hashmaps and linkedlists are used for storage and reference to the relations of tunnels to vehicles. JUnit test classes are included for testing the simulation of multiple types of vehicles trying to pass through various tunnels.
