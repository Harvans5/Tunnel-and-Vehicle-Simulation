# Tunnel-and-Vehicle-Simulation
This project simulates various types of vehicles, using an abstract class for vehicle with sleds, cars and ambulances extending this class and representing threads, traveling through multiple different tunnels with restrictions on amount, type and direction. This project utilizes various data structures and operating system techniques, using locks and conditions to prevent the threads from busy-waiting and priority queues for vehicles waiting to enter an open and suitable tunnel. This project also uses hashmaps and linkedlists for storage and reference to the relations of tunnels to vehicles. This project also contains various JUnit test classes for testing the simulation of multiple types of vehicles trying to pass through various tunnels.
